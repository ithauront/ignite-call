# üìÖ Ignite Call ‚Äî Fullstack Scheduling App

A fullstack scheduling application built with **Next.js**, designed to simplify appointment scheduling by integrating seamlessly with **Google Calendar**. This project allows users to authenticate via Google, see their calendar availability, and receive new meeting invitations, while preventing double-bookings and past-dated appointments.

## üîó Live Demo

You can try the live app here:  
[ignite-call](https://ignite-call-six-wheat.vercel.app)


## üîê Authentication (Google OAuth)

This project uses **NextAuth** to enable authentication via Google. The app requests access to the user's calendar to allow scheduling. The OAuth app is registered and deployed in test mode.

### üß™ Test Account

**The app is published on Google Cloud in test mode.**
**Only users added to the OAuth test list can authenticate unless using the test account below:**

- **Email**: `testignitecalltest@gmail.com`  
- **Password**: `testignite12call3`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please use this only for demo purposes. Do not store any private or sensitive information in this account.

## üß¨ Concepts

This application applies and demonstrates several important concepts:

- **Dynamic routing** using `/schedule/[username]` to access each user's public calendar.
- **Backend logic** for checking past dates, blocked days, and user-defined availability intervals. All centralized in the same monorepo, thanks to Next.js API routes.
- **Automatic token refresh**, ensuring long-term access to the user's Google Calendar.
- **SEO configuration** with `next-seo` and `DefaultSeo` to improve discoverability and metadata control.
